# multi-speaker-tacotron

This is an implementation of our paper from ICASSP 2020:  
"Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker Text-To-Speech with State-of-the-art Neural Speaker Embeddings," by Erica Cooper, Cheng-I Lai, Yusuke Yasuda, Fuming Fang, Xin Wang, Nanxin Chen, and Junichi Yamagishi.

## News:
 * 2022-03-29: Migrated data from Dropbox to Zenodo.
 * 2021-06-21: Added scripts for creating tfrecords to synthesize new texts using pretrained models.  See directory `synthesize_new_texts` and its README.
 * 2020-08-10: Added example scripts for our new paper accepted to Interspeech 2020, <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01245>"Can Speaker Augmentation Improve Multi-Speaker End-to-End TTS?"</a>  See directory `is20` and please also update your copies of `tacotron2` and `self-attention-tacotron` repositories as these contain some necessary changes.

## Dependencies:  

It is recommended to set up a miniconda environment for using Tacotron.  https://repo.anaconda.com
```
conda create -n taco python=3.6.8
conda activate taco
conda install tensorflow-gpu scipy matplotlib docopt hypothesis pyspark unidecode
conda install -c conda-forge librosa
pip install inflect pysptk
```

Install this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/multi-speaker-tacotron.git external/multi_speaker_tacotron
```

Install Tacotron dependencies if you don't have them already:
```
mkdir external
git clone https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/tacotron2.git external/tacotron2
git clone https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/self-attention-tacotron.git external/self_attention_tacotron
```
Note the renaming of hyphens to underscores; this is necessary because “-” is an invalid character in Python.

Next, download project data and models, ~~from the dropbox folder here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rq4lebus0n8tmso/AACldbmKDPRN9YiXrRROjtTSa?dl=0~~  **The data has been moved to Zenodo.  You can find it here:  https://zenodo.org/record/6349897#.YkKR-C8Rr0o**
 * Preprocessed VCTK data: in the `data` directory
 * VCTK Tacotron models: in the `tacotron-models` directory
 * VCTK Wavenet models: in the `wavenet-models` directory

Training from scratch using the VCTK data only is possible using the script `train_from_scratch.sh`; this does not require the Nancy pre-trained model which due to licensing restrictions we are unable to share.

To use our pre-trained WaveNet models, you will also need our WaveNet implementation which can be found here:
https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/project-CURRENNT-scripts

To obtain embeddings for new samples, you will need the neural speaker embedding code which can be found here:
https://github.com/jefflai108/pytorch-kaldi-neural-speaker-embeddings

## How to use

See the scripts `warmup.sh` (warm start training), `train_from_scratch.sh` (train on VCTK data only), and `predictmel.sh` (prediction).  The scripts assume a SLURM-type computing environment.  You will need to change the paths to match your environments and point to your data.  Here are the parameters relevant to multi-speaker TTS:
 * `source-data-root` and `target-data-root`: path to your source and target preprocessed data
 * `selected-list-dir`: train/eval/test set definitions
 * `batch_size`: if you get OOM errors, try reducing the batch size
 * `use_external_speaker_embedding=True`: use speaker embeddings that you provide from a file (see the files in the `speaker_embeddings` directory)
 * `embedding_file`: path to the file containing your speaker embeddings
 * `speaker_embedding_dim`:  dimension should match the dimension in your embedding file <!-- TODO: deprecate this -->
 * `speaker_embedding_projection_out_dim=64`: We found experimentally that projecting the speaker embedding to a lower dimension helped to reduce overfitting.  You can try different values, but to use our pretrained multi-speaker models you will have to use 64.
 * `speaker_embedding_offset`: must match the ID of your first speaker.  <!-- TODO: deprecate this -->

The scripts are set up using `embedding_file="vctk-x-vector.txt",speaker_embedding_dim='200'` which is default x-vectors.  Please change it to `embedding_file="vctk-lde-3.txt",speaker_embedding_dim='512'` to use LDE embeddings from our best system.

<!-- num_speakers does not actually get used with external_embedding so TODO remove this from the scripts. -->
