The Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT)

    - the more overlap, the smoother, but more computational intensive
    - window_size/frame_size := # miliseconds in each window_size
        - needs to go through a window function such as the Hann Window function to smooth the data
    - hop_size := # miliseconds overlap
        - overlap is meant to reverse the effect of window function
